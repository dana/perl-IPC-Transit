YAML: starts with ---
JSON: Starts with {
Data::Dumper: Starts with $VAR1 = 
Storable: Looks like it starts with Octal 003404

The Message:
Must be a hash reference.

Only the .transit key is reserved.
By default, it is not returned.
Maybe some stuff it has:
.transit => {
    checksum => $sum,
    checksum_type => $what kind of crypto,
    send_ts => $epoch_time,
    receive_ts => $epoch_time,
},
