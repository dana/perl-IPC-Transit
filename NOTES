Totally random thoughts and stream of consciousness.

This stuff might be inaccurate, out of date, wrong and/or crazy.

Serialization


First, we have, in ascii, an integer followed by a colon.  This is,
excluding these characters, how long the header is.  Meaning, if you
skip that many bytes, you'll be pointing to the first byte of the actual
message.

So the serialized message has the following parts

header length
header
message

Example:

header length:3:
header:xyz
message:{"a":"b"}

Full serialized thing:
3:xyz{"a":"b"}

IPC::Transit::Serialize

freeze()
takes:  message hash
        args to control freeze
returns: fully serialized message

thaw()
takes: fully serialized message
returns:    message
            header info






The Message:
Must be a hash reference.

Only the .transit key is reserved.
By default, it is not returned.
Maybe some stuff it has:
.transit => {
    checksum => $sum,
    checksum_type => $what kind of crypto,
    send_ts => $epoch_time,
    receive_ts => $epoch_time,
},
