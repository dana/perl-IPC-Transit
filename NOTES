Serialization


IPC::Transit::Serialize

freeze()
takes:  message
        args to control freeze
returns: fully serialized message

thaw()
takes: fully serialized message
returns:    message





The Message:
Must be a hash reference.

Only the .transit key is reserved.
By default, it is not returned.
Maybe some stuff it has:
.transit => {
    checksum => $sum,
    checksum_type => $what kind of crypto,
    send_ts => $epoch_time,
    receive_ts => $epoch_time,
},
