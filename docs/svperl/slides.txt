Basic Tenents of Message Based Programming

Message Defined:
Any complex (but 'normal') Perl data structure that starts as a hash reference
at the top level.

Normal is defined as scalars, arrays and hashes.

{   this => 'thing',
    stuff => ['x', 10, 'y']
}

If possible, keep it this simple.

It maps well to other languages.

Works with all serialization methods.

BUT

{   this => 'thing',
    stuff => sub {
        return ['x', $main::foo++, qr/^x$/],
    },

}

Is fun too!

Keep it this simple if possible, because it maps well to other languages.

It also maps well to many underlying serialization methods.

Think of this method as a dynamic pipeline.

Each Stage is one or more of

A daemon

A coroutine

Coroutine: no blocking!
